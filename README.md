# CS-255-System-Analysis-And-Design


    **Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
DriverPass is a company that is trying to provide a better way for student drivers to study for their driving exams as well as a way to schedule appointments for a practical driving test. What we were contracted to do is to make a website that will allow their customers to create an account, purchase a package for their study, take practice tests online, and also schedule appointments with one of the instructors to practice driving. 
    
    What did you do particularly well?
I think that the diagrams and their explanations were very good with the information I wanted to convey as well as show the bare minimum of the systems that we would need to create for it.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
When it comes to things that I would change, I would like to be a bit more in-depth in the designs and offer more things in order to make the designs more complete, The other thing that I would do is include more things into business requirements document mainly in describing the constraints as well as the limitations.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To understand the user needs I started to consider their technical requirements. In doing this I created use cases as well as diagrams that would fit the use cases that I had made. In these requirements that were given, they had shown that they want a website for their users. Since the Users are the main people that will use the website their needs will be the most important ones to consider.
    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When thinking of how to understand the software that we are meant to create. I think that the functional and non-functional requirements are essential steps in creating the software or program that our contractor would want. Another thing that I believe can help us understand the requirements is to make diagrams of how we think the system would plan to work and present that to either a scrum leader if working in an agile method or presenting directly to the company that had contracted us.
